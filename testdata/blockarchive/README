This is a tiny block archive for testing. It contains:
* 5 valid tiny block files, although two are misplaced - one is in the root, one is in the wrong sub-directory
* a strange file that is not a block file in the root (this file)
* a strange file that has a ".bin" extension but the name is not a valid hash
